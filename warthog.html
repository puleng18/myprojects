                <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                <p>Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) are wild pigs native to Africa. They are easily recognized by their distinctive appearance, featuring large tusks, a flat face, and a tuft of coarse hair along their backs. Warthogs are well adapted to their savannah and grassland habitats, where they use their strong snouts to dig for roots and tubers.</p>
                <p>These animals are primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses, fruits, and bark. Warthogs are known for their unique behavior of kneeling on their front knees while feeding, which allows them to reach the ground more easily. They are social animals, often found in small groups consisting of females and their young, while adult males tend to be more solitary.</p>
                <p>Warthogs have a number of adaptations that help them survive in the wild. Their tusks, which are actually elongated canine teeth, are used for defense against predators and for digging. Warthogs also have a tough hide that provides protection from thorns and other hazards in their environment.</p>
                <p>These animals are currently listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and hunting. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their populations and habitats. You can find warthogs at the zoo in the African savannah exhibit.</p>
                <p>You will find the warthogs at W5, near the entrance to the savannah.</p>

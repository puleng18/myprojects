                <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals, known for their long necks and legs. They are native to Africa and inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands. Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees and shrubs. Their long necks allow them to reach high branches that other herbivores cannot access.</p>
                <p>Giraffes have a unique social structure, often forming loose herds of females and their young, while adult males are more solitary. They communicate using a variety of vocalizations, body postures, and even infrasonic sounds that are below the range of human hearing. Giraffes are also known for their distinctive coat patterns, which vary between individuals and help with camouflage in their natural habitat.</p>
                <p>These gentle giants are currently facing threats from habitat loss and poaching. Conservation efforts are underway to protect giraffe populations and their habitats. You can find giraffes at the zoo in the African savannah exhibit.</p>
                <p>You will find the giraffes at G15, just beyond the research centre.</p>

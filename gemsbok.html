                <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
                <p>Gemsboks are large antelopes found in the arid regions of southern Africa. They are known for their striking appearance, with long, straight horns and a distinctive black and white facial pattern. Gemsboks are well adapted to their harsh environment, able to go without water for long periods by extracting moisture from the vegetation they eat.</p>
                <p>These animals are social creatures, often found in small herds consisting of females and their young. Males are more solitary and may only join herds during the breeding season. Gemsboks are primarily grazers, feeding on grasses and other vegetation, and are known for their incredible stamina and speed, able to run at high speeds to escape predators.</p>
                <p>Gemsboks are found in a variety of habitats, including savannahs, grasslands, and deserts. They are most commonly seen in the Kalahari Desert and surrounding areas. These animals are well adapted to their environment, with a thick hide that protects them from the sun and the ability to regulate their body temperature.</p>
                <p>You will find the gemsboks at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

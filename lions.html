                <h3>LIONS</h3>
                <p>Lions are the second-largest big cat species in the world (Panthera leo), after tigers. They are known for their majestic appearance, with males sporting a distinctive mane. Lions are social animals, living in groups called prides, which typically consist of related females, their cubs, and a small number of adult males.</p>
                <p>These apex predators primarily hunt large ungulates, such as zebras and wildebeests, using cooperative hunting strategies. Lions are most active during the cooler hours of the day, such as early morning and late afternoon, and they spend a significant amount of time resting and lounging in the shade.</p>
                <p>Lions are found in a variety of habitats, including savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands. They are currently listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Conservation efforts are underway to protect lion populations and their habitats. You can find lions at the zoo in the African savannah exhibit.</p>
                <p>You will find the lions at the Northern Frontier.</p>

                <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                <p>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family (Felidae) and are known for their powerful build and striking orange coat with black stripes. They are native to Asia and are primarily found in forests, grasslands, and swamps. Tigers are solitary animals, with each individual having its own territory.</p>
                <p>These apex predators primarily hunt large ungulates, such as deer and wild boar, using their strength and stealth to ambush prey. Tigers are excellent swimmers and often hunt in water, making them unique among big cats.</p>
                <p>Tigers are currently listed as endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and ensure the survival of this iconic species. You can find tigers at the zoo in the Asian rainforest exhibit.</p>
                <p>You will find the tigers at T3, near the waterfall.</p>

                <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, easily recognized by their large, round faces and fluffy ears. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most other animals. Koalas have a specialized digestive system that allows them to detoxify the chemicals in the leaves and extract the necessary nutrients.</p>
                <p>These animals are mostly nocturnal, spending up to 18 hours a day sleeping in the trees to conserve energy. Koalas are solitary creatures, with each individual having its own home range. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including grunts and bellows, especially during the breeding season.</p>
                <p>Koalas are currently listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss, climate change, and disease. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their natural habitats and ensure the survival of this iconic species. You can find koalas at the zoo in the Australian bush exhibit.</p>
                <p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>

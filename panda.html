                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>Pandas, also known as giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), are large bears native to China. They are easily recognized by their distinctive black and white coloration. Pandas primarily inhabit bamboo forests in the mountainous regions of central China, where they spend most of their time eating bamboo, which makes up 99% of their diet.</p>
                    <p>Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas have adapted to a herbivorous diet and have strong jaw muscles and large molars for crushing bamboo. They are solitary animals, with each adult having its own home range. Pandas are also known for their playful behavior, often seen climbing trees or rolling on the ground.</p>
                    <p>Due to habitat loss and low birth rates, giant pandas are currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and ensure the survival of this iconic species. You can find pandas at the zoo in the Asian rainforest exhibit.</p>
                    <p>You will find the pandas at Panda Canyon.</p>

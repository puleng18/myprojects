                <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                <p>Monkeys are a diverse group of primates found in various habitats, including tropical rainforests, savannahs, and mountains. They are known for their agility, intelligence, and complex social structures. Monkeys are generally divided into two main groups: New World monkeys, which are native to the Americas, and Old World monkeys, which are found in Africa and Asia.</p>
                <p>New World monkeys, such as capuchins and howler monkeys, often have prehensile tails that help them navigate the trees. They are typically smaller and have flatter noses compared to their Old World counterparts. Old World monkeys, like baboons and macaques, are usually larger and have non-prehensile tails. They are more terrestrial and can often be found foraging on the ground.</p>
                <p>Monkeys are omnivorous, feeding on a varied diet that includes fruits, leaves, seeds, and insects. They are highly social animals, living in troops that can range from a few individuals to several hundred. Communication among monkeys is complex, involving vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language.</p>
                <p>Many monkey species are currently threatened by habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal pet trade. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and ensure their survival. You can find monkeys at the zoo in the primate exhibit.</p>
                <p>You will find the monkeys at the monkey cage near the Monkey Trail.</p>

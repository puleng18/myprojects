                <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates and are native to the forests of central Africa. They are ground-dwelling and primarily herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and flowers. Gorillas are highly social animals, living in groups led by a dominant male known as a silverback. These groups can consist of several females and their offspring.</p>
                <p>Gorillas are known for their intelligence and complex social structures. They communicate using a variety of vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions. Despite their size and strength, gorillas are generally gentle and shy animals, often displaying playful behavior, especially among young individuals.</p>
                <p>There are two species of gorillas: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, each with its own subspecies. Both species are critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Conservation efforts are underway to protect gorilla populations and their habitats. You can find gorillas at the zoo in the African rainforest exhibit.</p>
               <p>You will find the gorillas at G12, near the entrance to the rainforest.</p>
